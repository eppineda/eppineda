- 👋 Hi, I’m @eppineda
- 👀 I’m interested in (mostly) Javascript technologies that support my projects (and, I sometimes have many): mobile software development and web software development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning too many things at once! Right now, practicing SvelteKit and (to pay the bills) the iOS and Android frameworks, using Objective-C and Java.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a couple of projects. If you choose to fork any of my repositories, a "hello" email is appreciated because I am interested when that does happen.
- 📫 How to reach me: professional inquiries to info@bit-mechanix.com, and non-business / hobbyists can reach me at enrique.pineda@gmail.com.
